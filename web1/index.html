            <p>The most important goal of effective communication is clarity. Clarity is not the same as simplicity. Often, simple things are clear if the message is intended to be brief and small, but if the message is about a complex relationship that can only be presented with a necessarily large amount of data.</p>
            
            <div class="alert">
                <p>This complexity can be made to appear clear by effective organization and presentation and need not be reduced to meaningless "bite-sized" chunks of data, as simplification usually does.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Clarity refers to the focus of one particular message or goal at a time, rather than attempting to accomplish too much at once. Simplicity is often responsible for the "dumbing" down of information rather than the illumination of it.</p>

            <h4>Explain the difference between the "alt" attribute and the "title" attribute</h4>
            <p>Alt text allows for SEO to find out more information about an image and is also used by screen readers for accessibility. The title attribute is used to display additional information about an image when hovering over an image.</p>
