    <h2>My Assessment</h2>
    <p>The most important goal of effective communication is clarity. Clarity is not the same as simplicity. Often, siple things are clear if hte message is intended to be brief and small, but off the message is about a complex relationship that can only be presented with a necessarily large amount of data.</p>
    <div class ="image">
        <img src="/web1/assets/images/webpage-image.jpg" alt="stock image for project">
    </div>
    <div class="alert">
    <p>This complexity can be made to appear clear by effective organization and presentation and need not be reducted to meaningless "bite-sized" chunks of data, as simplification usually does</p>
    </div>
    <p>Clarity refers to the focus of one particular message or goal at a time, rather than attempting to accomplish too much at once. Simplicity is often resposible for the "dumbing" of information rather that the illumination of it.</p>
    <h3>Questions:</h3>   
    
    <h4>Emplain the difference between the "alt" attribute and the "title" attricute</h2>
    <p>alt text allows for the SEO to find out more inforation about an image and is also used
        by screen readers for accesibility. The title attribute is used to display additional information 
        about an image when hovering over an image.
