        <h2>Letter of Introduction</h2>
        <p>Dear Hiring Manager,</p>
        <p>I am excited to apply for the position at your company. With over twenty years of experience in the restaurant industry—covering both front-of-house and back-of-house operations—and a recent pivot into the field of information technology, I bring a well-rounded and adaptable perspective to the workplace.</p>
        <p>During the pandemic, I made the decision to return to school, earning an associate’s degree in Computer Information Systems with a specialization in Cybersecurity. I’m currently pursuing a bachelor’s degree in Information Science from the University of Arkansas at Little Rock. Additionally, I completed the IT/Cyber Fundamentals Program at The Forge Institute, which helped solidify my understanding of core cybersecurity principles and provided hands-on exposure to current tools and practices used in the field.</p>
        <p>Through my academic journey, I’ve gained practical skills in several key technical areas. In Web Technologies and Web Client Applications, I developed a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Courses such as Object-Oriented Technologies and Human Computer Interface introduced me to programming in Java and reinforced best practices in user-centered design. I’ve also worked extensively with SQL through Business Data Management Systems, Current Trends in Databases and Database security, gaining familiarity with platforms like MSSQL Server and Oracle Apex.</p>
        <p>With a unique combination of real-world leadership, customer-facing experience, and growing technical expertise, I’m confident in my ability to contribute meaningfully to your team. I’m especially motivated by opportunities to work in dynamic, learning-focused environments where I can continue to grow and help organizations improve their digital infrastructure and security posture.</p>
        <p>Thank you for your time and consideration. I’ve attached my resume for your review and would welcome the chance to further discuss how my background aligns with the goals of your company.</p>
        <p>Warm regards,</p>
